My journey to Prague has started with the hiring of my wife by a global company there. In this study, I give a brief insight about the population, house prices and types by comparing municipal parts of the city for anyone to buy a property in Prague or interested in the real estate industry. I&rsquo;ll go over these steps;</p><ul><li>Observe the municipal parts of Prague</li><li>Population distribution by municipal parts</li><li>House prices by municipal parts</li><li>Number of different types of venues inside 1km radius of the center of municipal parts</li><li>Cluster municipal parts of Prague</li></ul><h4 id=municipal-parts-of-prague>Municipal Parts of Prague</h4><p>If you visited Prague, probably you might have been to Prague 1, 2 and 3, however, the city has fifty-seven municipal parts according to the official resources, while the first twenty-second region is called by a number, others by names.</p><p>Here is a map of Prague regions which I created using Folium library of Python.<br><br><img src=1.gif><br><br></p><h4 id=population-of-prague-by-municipal-parts>Population of Prague by Municipal Parts</h4><p>I downloaded the population data for 57 Municipal Parts of Prague from the web page below and created a pandas data frame. Resource: <a href=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/czechrep/praguecity/>https://www.citypopulation.de/en/czechrep/praguecity/</a><br><br><img src=2.png><br><br>Let&rsquo;s visualize the population of Prague, with the help of choropleth library.<br><br><img src=3.png><br><br>There are more people living in Praha 4 and 10 than other municipal regions.</p><h4 id=house-sale-prices>House Sale Prices</h4><p>Sreality.cz is one of the most used websites for advertisement of houses in Czech Republic. I scraped all available house advertisements in the website for Prague and refined the data. In the data frame below, there are 4390 advertising with its features.<br><br><img src=3g.png><br><br>By using latitude and longitude and Prague municipal part geojson file, I received region info for each object and drop title column. First 5 items of the data frame are below.<br><br><img src=4g.png><br><br>Let&rsquo;s do some Exploratory Data Analysis excluding the items belonging to the municipal parts having advertisements less than 30.<br><br><img src=4.png><br><br>Average prices for a house in Praha 1 and Praha 6 are higher than others.<br><br><img src=5.png><br><br>The houses in Praha 1 and Praha 6 are larger than others.
Price per square meter is one of the most popular metrics in the real estates industry.<br><br><img src=6.png><br><br>The price per square meter is high for Praha 1 and Praha 2, compared to others.
Praha 6 is not in the first ranks for the price per square meter, however it was in the first ranks for the average price for a house, it seems that the reason for this, the size of the houses in Praha 6 is larger.</p><p>Here I would like to describe type of the houses in Czech Republic. The naming could be unfamiliar to you but basically,</p><ul><li>1+1: one room and one separated kitchen</li><li>1+kk: one room and the kitchen is inside room</li><li>2+1: two rooms and one separated kitchen</li><li>2+kk: two rooms and the kitchen is inside one of the room</li><li>2+kk is most prevalent house type in Prague.<br><br><img src=7.png><br><br>We may wonder where the most expensive houses are located in Prague.<br><br><img src=8.png><br><br>The most expensive houses are mainly located in Praha 1.</li></ul><h4 id=clustering-municipal-parts-by-venues>Clustering Municipal Parts by Venues</h4><p>In this section, I will cluster municipal parts based on the number of venues in different categories around the center of the municipal parts. I defined the latitude and longitude of the center of the municipal parts and obtained the available venues in 1 km radius of the center point by using Google Places API.<br><br><img src=9.png><br><br>I created a data frame for the first ten municipal parts and its surrounding supermarkets, bus stations, museums, subway stations and pharmacies.<br><br><img src=10.png><br><br></p><h4 id=k-means-clustering>K-means Clustering</h4><p>After applying k-means clustering from scikit-learn library, the municipal parts are divided into 3 clusters.<br><br><img src=11.png><br><br>It seems that Praha 1 and 2 have many venues around the center so these two are distinctive than others. Praha 5 can be separated because it comes forward with bus station availability. Other regions have similar features.</p><h3 id=results-and-discussions>Results and Discussions</h3><ul><li>There are more people living in Praha 4 and 10 than other municipal regions.</li><li>Average prices for a house in Praha 1 and 6 are higher than others.</li><li>The houses in Praha 1 and Praha 6 are larger than others.</li><li>The price per square meter is high for Praha 1 and 2, compared to others.</li><li>Praha 6 is not in the first ranks for the price per square meter, however it was in the first ranks for the average price for a house, it seems that the reason of this, the size of the houses in Praha 6 is larger.</li><li>2+kk is the most prevalent house type in Prague.</li><li>The most expensive houses are mainly located in Praha 1.</li><li>Based on the venues available, Prague municipal parts can be divided in three clusters.</li></ul><p>Do the venues around municipal parts contribute to the price of the house?<br><br><img src=12.png><br><br><img src=13.png><br><br>Yes. We may divide the municipal parts to 3 groups based on price per square meter. Praha 1 and 2 are more expensive than other municipal parts, following Praha 5 and others. This fits the cluster which is created only by the numbers of different types of venues around the municipal parts&rsquo; center.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Prague has 57 municipal parts and each of them may have different features. However some of them have more venues around and this contributes to the price of the house.</p><p>Ufuk Taner CEYHANLI<br><br><br><br><br><br></p><h6 id=github-repository-httpsgithubcomtanerceyhanlidata-analysis-of-house-sales-prices-and-venues-in-prague-with-python>Github Repository: <a href=https://github.com/tanerceyhanli/Data-Analysis-of-House-Sales-Prices-and-Venues-in-Prague-with-Python>https://github.com/tanerceyhanli/Data-Analysis-of-House-Sales-Prices-and-Venues-in-Prague-with-Python</a></h6><h6 id=jupyter-notebook-httpsgithubcomtanerceyhanlidata-analysis-of-house-sales-prices-and-venues-in-prague-with-pythonblobmaindata-analysis-of-house-sales-prices-and-venues-in-prague-with-pythonipynb>Jupyter Notebook: <a href=https://github.com/tanerceyhanli/Data-Analysis-of-House-Sales-Prices-and-Venues-in-Prague-with-Python/blob/main/Data-Analysis-of-House-Sales-Prices-and-Venues-in-Prague-with-Python.ipynb>https://github.com/tanerceyhanli/Data-Analysis-of-House-Sales-Prices-and-Venues-in-Prague-with-Python/blob/main/Data-Analysis-of-House-Sales-Prices-and-Venues-in-Prague-with-Python.ipynb</a></h6><h6 id=linkedin-post-httpswwwlinkedincompulsehouse-sales-prices-venues-data-analysis-prague-python-ceyhanlc4b1>Linkedin Post: <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/house-sales-prices-venues-data-analysis-prague-python-ceyhanl%C4%B1/>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/house-sales-prices-venues-data-analysis-prague-python-ceyhanl%C4%B1/</a></h6></div><hr><div class="row next-prev-navigator"><div class="col-md-6 previous-article"><a href=/posts/insights-to-food-prices-in-czech-republic-by-using-tableau/ class="btn btn-outline-info"><span><i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-left"></i> Prev</span><br><span>Insights to Food Prices in Czech Republic by using Tableau</span></a></div><div class="col-md-6 next-article"><a href=/posts/forecasting-of-gasoline-med-fob-price-based-on-historical-data/ class="btn btn-outline-info"><span>Next <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></span><br><span>Forecasting of Gasoline MED-FOB Price Based on Historical Data with Python</span></a></div></div><hr></div></div></div></section><section class=toc-section id=toc-section></section></div><footer class="container-fluid text-center align-content-center footer pb-2"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Navigation</h5><ul><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#skills>Skills</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#about>About</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#recent-posts>Posts</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=#achievements>Certificates</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Contact me:</h5><ul><li><span>Email:</span> <span>contact@ufukceyhanli.com</span></li><li><span>Phone:</span> <span>+420777655815</span></li></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/assets/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js></script>
