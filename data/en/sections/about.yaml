# a summary about you
summary: 'Hi, my name is Ufuk and I am a data professional with an engineering background and a master degree focusing on analytics.
Since I was a kid, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. 
So thatâ€™s how I look at big data sets: to me it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.
I have worked with lots of diffrent datasets which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understandable insights.'
